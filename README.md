# Mathematical Modeling Algorithms and Applications
The code is from the book Mathematical Modeling Algorithms and Applications completely by typing given that we have the official resource download link http://www.ndip.cn/download_list/columnsId=7&FrontColumns_navigation01-1389769857789FirstColumnId=7&downloadcategoryid=2.html. The original MATLAB code provided by the authors is purported to be checked, but the LINGO code is not, and relatively the code is not very neat. Besides, some of the code snippets that are not classified under any example problems or exercises are missing. However, all of the code in this repository has been successfully compiled except those with missing data, and the corresponding Lingo reports (*.lgr) are also provided. In fact, while writing and compiling the original MATLAB code on the book, there are many errors and warnings given by the MATLAB compiler. For example, there should not be any semicolon at the end of the sentence that declares a MATLAB function. All of them have been corrected. Some of them need not be repaired, such as canceling output in the command line by adding a semicolon at the end of sentences.

In this repository, we use "E" for example code, "S" for solution code, "C" for independent code on the main book.

Note that E4_21 gives different results from that on the book.
