# Mathematical Modeling Algorithms and Applications
 The code is from the book Mathematical Modeling Algorithms and Applications completely by typing given that we have the official resource download link http://www.ndip.cn/download_list/columnsId=7&FrontColumns_navigation01-1389769857789FirstColumnId=7&downloadcategoryid=2.html. The original MATLAB code provided by the authors is purported to be checked, but LINGO code is not, and relatively the code is not very neat. However, all of the code in this repository has been successfully compiled except those with missing data, and the corresponding Lingo reports (*.lgr) are also provided. Actually, during writing the code, many errors or warnings were shown when running the original MATLAB code. For example, there should not be any semicolon at the end of the sentence that declares a MATLAB function. All of them have been corrected. Some of them need not be repaired, such as canceling output in the command line by adding a semicolon at the end of sentences.
